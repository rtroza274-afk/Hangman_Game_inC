## 🚀 Key Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Guess letters one at a time to uncover a hidden word before running out of attempts.
- **Modular Architecture:** Cleanly separated into `main.c`, `hangman.c`, and `hangman.h` for maintainable, team-friendly development.
- **Dynamic Word Bank:** Words are loaded from an external `data/words.txt` file, making the word list easy to expand without touching game logic.
- **Randomized Word Selection:** A different word is chosen each playthrough for replayability.
- **Limited Guess System:** Tracks incorrect guesses and ends the game once the guess limit is reached.
- **Live Progress Display:** Shows the partially revealed word and previously guessed letters after every turn.
- **Custom ASCII Art:** Branded ANSI Shadow–style title banner styled to match the game's visual identity.
- **UTF-8 Console Support:** Uses `SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)` for correct character rendering on Windows terminals.
- **Input Validation:** Handles invalid, repeated, and non-alphabetic input gracefully without crashing.
- **Win/Loss Detection:** Clear end-game messaging for both successful guesses and game-over states.
- **Replay Option:** Lets players start a new round without restarting the program.
- **Cross-Environment Build:** Compiles cleanly with GCC on Windows via a simple two-file build command.
- **Hint availability:** In case of brainstorming, there is possible hints to take by the user.
